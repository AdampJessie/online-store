# Digital Emporium

## Description of the Project

Welcome to the Digital Emporium! This program reads products from a CSV input file.
These products populate the store, where users can view available products, place them in a virtual cart,
and then check out with virtual money!

## User Stories

- As a store owner, I'd like to load products from a messy file into a properly formatted inventory list so that customers can see all of my products in a stylish fashion

- As a store owner, I'd like customers to enter a product ID to add/remove from cart so that there is no confusion surrounding which products are which.

- As a customer, I'd like to view my cart with a total amount attached, so that I know the full price of my purchase.

- As a store owner, I'd like customers to check out once they are finished shopping, so that I can make money and customers can receive the products they want.
